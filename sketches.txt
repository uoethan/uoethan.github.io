ball|Balls that bounce.|Bouncing Balls|<b>WORK IN PROGRESS</b><br>Currently this just spawns 10 balls that bounce off the sides of the canvas.<br>I am currently working on accurate ball collisions, so they can bounce off each other<br>Press ENTER to reset the balls.
orthagonal-raycaster|What it says on the tin!|Orthagonal Raycaster|Use the <b>ARROW KEYS</b> to move.<br>A small raycast engine that uses casts rays from a flat plane rather than from a single point.<br>This was a little experiment that I created because previous raycasters that I made had pretty extreme fisheye.<br>This experiment didn't work out as planned because the camera plane needs to be wide to produce a large enough view port. The middle ground between the two solutions, is the widely used solution of casting rays from a single point and checking for intersection with a small plane in front of the point.
islands|A small island generator.|Island Generator|<br>Press the "Generate Islands" button to create a new world.<br>This procedurally generates islands using noise. This is mostly a recolouring of an image of noise, but this technique, in some form or another, is used in numerous games such as Minecraft.<br><br>There's a small bug with the button doing its own thing. That's because the button is generated in p5.js and isn't fully compatible with my stylesheet.
