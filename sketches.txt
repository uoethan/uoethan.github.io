ball|Balls that bounce.|Bouncing Balls|<b>WORK IN PROGRESS</b><br>Currently this just spawns 10 balls that bounce off the sides of the canvas.<br>I am currently working on accurate ball collisions, so they can bounce off each other<br>Press ENTER to reset the balls.
orthagonal-raycaster|What it says on the tin!|Orthagonal Raycaster|Use the <b>ARROW KEYS</b> to move.<br>A small raycast engine that uses casts rays from a flat plane rather than from a single point.<br>This was a little experiment that I created because previous raycasters that I made had pretty extreme fisheye.<br>This experiment didn't work out as planned because the camera plane needs to be wide to produce a large enough view port. The middle ground between the two solutions, is the widely used solution of casting rays from a single point and checking for intersection with a small plane in front of the point.
