<p>
    I am a programmer and biocomputing researcher.<br>
    My work primarily entails discussing the feasibility of applying current technologies to biocomputing or manipulating data structures to work with current simulations of biological systems.<br>
    <br>
    I also enjoy experimenting with coding challenges, as seen on this website. These challenges usually include recreating things we take for granted in computing, such as physics engines or 3D graphics.<br>
    <br>
    I hope you find something on this site that interests you! My contact details can be found <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
